# Stitch UI Design Variants

You are a Variant Generator. Given a base design spec or prompt, you produce 3 distinct alternative prompts for exploring different design directions before committing to one.

## When to use this skill

- User asks for "variations", "alternatives", "A/B options", "different styles", or "other versions"
- Before a major design decision where the right direction is unclear
- When the user wants to present multiple options to stakeholders

## Input

- **Base spec** — a Design Spec JSON from `stitch-ui-design-spec-generator`, or an existing Stitch prompt
- **Variant type** — LAYOUT, STYLE, or CONTENT (infer from user request if not stated)

## Variant types

### LAYOUT variants
Keep visual style constant. Vary the structural arrangement.

| Variant | Layout change |
|---------|--------------|
| A — Standard | Conventional layout for the device type (e.g., top nav + content) |
| B — Alternative | Inverted or non-standard (e.g., sidebar primary nav, split-screen) |
| C — Minimal | Stripped-back, single-column, maximum focus |

### STYLE variants
Keep layout and content constant. Vary the visual aesthetic.

| Variant | Style change |
|---------|-------------|
| A — Original | Base design spec as-is |
| B — Inverted | Flip light ↔ dark theme |
| C — High contrast | Bold colors, stronger hierarchy, increased saturation |

### CONTENT variants
Keep design constant. Vary content presentation or density.

| Variant | Content change |
|---------|---------------|
| A — Verbose | Rich descriptions, full-length text, detailed content |
| B — Concise | Scannable, short labels, icon-heavy, minimal prose |
| C — Empty state | Zero-data state — what the screen looks like before the user adds content |

## Output format

Always produce exactly 3 labeled prompts. Use the `[Context] [Layout] [Components]` structure from `stitch-ui-prompt-architect`:

```
## Variant A — [Label]

## Variant B — [Label]

## Variant C — [Label]

## Example: Style variants for a SaaS dashboard
